This folder contains relevant experiment results.

To reproduce the results, run the following files sequentially: COMPOSITE_RNA_results.ipynb, COMPOSITE_ADT_and_RNA+ADT.ipynb, 
COMPOSITE_ATAC_and_RNA+ATAC_results.ipynb, and COMPOSITE_DOGMA_results.ipynb.
These files contain the evaluations of single-omics and multiomics prediction results of COMPOSITE, under default parameter settings.
Only the stable feature values and the ground truth multiplet labels are needed to reproduce the results. 
These data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11167173.
