This folder contains relevant experiment results.

To reproduce the results, run the following files sequentially: COMPOSITE_RNA_results.ipynb, COMPOSITE_ADT_and_RNA+ADT.ipynb, COMPOSITE_ATAC_and_RNA+ATAC_results.ipynb, and 	COMPOSITE_DOGMA_results.ipynb.
These files contain the evaluations of single-omics and multiomics prediction results of COMPOSITE.
Only the stable feature values and the multiplet labels are needed to reproduce the results. These data will be available on this Github repository once the paper is published.
